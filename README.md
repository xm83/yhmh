The intersection of mental health and technology

HACK MENTAL HEALTH

Let's come together to majorly redesign tech tools in a more meaningful, socially responsible way, leveraging the power of a truly interdisciplinary dialogue, including academics, designers, ethicists, computer scientists, psychologists, entrepreneurs, educators, and many more. We invite you to participate in one of the most pressing tasks in a rapidly transforming technological age: humanely redesigning an existing technology.
